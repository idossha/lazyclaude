# lazyclaude

A lazygit-inspired TUI for managing Claude Code configuration. One place to view and edit memory, skills, MCP servers, permissions, hooks, instructions, keybindings, agents, sessions, stats, plugins, and todos — across user and project scopes.

## Install

### Prebuilt binaries (recommended)

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/idohaber/lazyclaude/releases/latest), then:

```sh
tar xzf lazyclaude-*.tar.gz
sudo install lazyclaude-*/lazyclaude /usr/local/bin/
```

### From crates.io

```sh
cargo install lazyclaude
```

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/idohaber/lazyclaude.git
cd lazyclaude
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```sh
lazyclaude                    # launch TUI
lazyclaude --version          # show version
lazyclaude --json             # dump all config as JSON
lazyclaude list mcp           # list a single source as JSON
lazyclaude paths              # show resolved config paths
```

Override paths for custom setups:

```sh
lazyclaude --claude-dir ~/.claude --project-dir /path/to/project
```

Available sources for `list`: `memory`, `skills`, `commands`, `mcp`, `settings`, `hooks`, `claude-md`, `keybindings`, `agents`, `stats`, `plugins`, `todos`.

## Panels

| Key | Panel | Scope | Description |
|-----|-------|-------|-------------|
| `1` | Projects | -- | Switch active project context |
| `2` | Config | User + Project | CLAUDE.md and rules (edit) |
| `3` | Memory | Project | Memory files (edit/delete) |
| `4` | Skills | User + Project | Skill definitions (create/search/install) |
| `5` | Agents | User + Project | Agent definitions (create/edit) |

| `0` | Plugins | Global | Installed, blocked, marketplaces (search/install) |
| -- | Todos | Global | Todo items from Claude sessions |

## Features

- **Auto-refresh**: Config files are watched for changes — the TUI updates automatically when you edit files in another terminal
- **Fuzzy search**: The `/` filter and search overlay use fuzzy matching (type `mcpgit` to find `mcp-server-git`)
- **Settings diff**: The Settings panel preview shows per-scope values (user/project/local) so you can see which scope defines each setting
- **Undo**: Press `u` to undo the last delete operation (supports memory, skills, agents, MCP servers, and permissions)
- **Clipboard**: `y` copies the current item, `x` exports the entire panel as JSON
- **Logging**: Diagnostics are written to `~/.claude/lazyclaude.log` (set `LAZYCLAUDE_LOG=debug` for verbose output)

## Architecture

lazyclaude is split into a library (`lazyclaude::config`, `lazyclaude::sources`) and a TUI binary. The library can be used by external tools:

```rust
let paths = lazyclaude::config::Paths::detect();
let data  = lazyclaude::sources::load_all(&paths);
```

The `--json` flag and `list` subcommand output structured JSON, enabling integration with editor plugins, scripts, or other tools.

## Claude Code File Layout

lazyclaude reads configuration from the paths below. This is the canonical reference for what Claude Code stores and where.

### Organization Level (managed, read-only)

```
macOS:     /Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md
Linux/WSL: /etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md
```

### Settings Merge Order

Settings are merged with increasing priority: **user < project < local**. Permissions use a three-tier evaluation: **deny > ask > allow** (first match wins).

### Hooks

Hooks are configured inside `settings.json` under the `hooks` key (not a separate file). They are available at all three settings scopes (user, project, local).

### Key Differences

| Item | Format | Location |
|------|--------|----------|
| Skills | Subdirectory with `SKILL.md` | `.claude/skills/<name>/` |
| Agents | Flat `.md` file | `.claude/agents/<name>.md` |
| Commands | Flat `.md` file (legacy) | `.claude/commands/<name>.md` |
| MCP | JSON with `mcpServers` key | `~/.mcp.json` or `.mcp.json` |
| Hooks | JSON inside `settings.json` | `hooks` key in settings |
| Memory | Auto-generated per project | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded>/memory/` |
